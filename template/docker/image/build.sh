# Kubler phase 1 config, pick installed packages and/or customize the build
#

# The recommended way to install software is setting ${_packages}
# List of Gentoo package atoms to be installed at custom root fs ${_EMERGE_ROOT}, optional, space separated
# If you are not sure about package names you may want to start an interactive build container:
#     kubler.sh build -i ${_tmpl_namespace}/${_tmpl_image_name}
# ..and then search the Portage database:
#     eix <search-string>
_packages=""
# Install a standard system directory layout at ${_EMERGE_ROOT}, optional, default: false
#BOB_INSTALL_BASELAYOUT=true

# Define custom variables to your liking

# This hook can be used to configure the build container itself, install packages, run any command, etc
#

    # Example for a manual build if _packages method does not suffice, a typical use case is a Go project:

    #export DISTRIBUTION_DIR="${GOPATH}/src/github.com/${_tmpl_namespace}/${_tmpl_image_name}"
    #mkdir -p "${DISTRIBUTION_DIR}"

    #cd "${DISTRIBUTION_DIR}"
    #git checkout tags/v${_${_tmpl_image_name}_version}
    #echo "building ${_tmpl_image_name} ${_${_tmpl_image_name}_version}.."
    #go run build.go build
    #mkdir -p "${_EMERGE_ROOT}"/usr/local/{bin,share}

    # Everything at ${_EMERGE_ROOT} will end up in the final image
    #cp -rp "${DISTRIBUTION_DIR}/bin/*" "${_EMERGE_ROOT}/usr/local/bin"

    # After installing packages manually you might want to add an entry to PACKAGES.md
    #log_as_installed "manual install" "${_tmpl_image_name}-${_${_tmpl_image_name}_version}" "https://${_tmpl_image_name}.org/"

    # To uninstall software packages in the builder unset ROOT env first
    #unset ROOT
    #emerge -C foo/bar
