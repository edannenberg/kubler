# Run a standard Docker health-check test as part of the build process. Add the health check as usual in
# Dockerfile.template and set this to true. Official docs: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck

# Any health-check args in the Dockerfile are overridden with the corresponding values below for the duration of

# Variables starting with BOB_ can be used for parameterization of Dockerfile.template and are also exported to
# the build container, i.e. they may be referenced in your build.sh
